In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.

key takeaways:
  - The law of large numbers asserts that when you take a sufficiently large sample, the observed average of that sample will closely approximate the true average of the entire population. Furthermore, this approximation becomes even closer as the sample size increases.

  - It's important to note that the law of large numbers doesn't guarantee that a given sample, especially a small one, will accurately reflect the characteristics of the entire population. Nor does it ensure that an unrepresentative sample will be corrected by a subsequent one.

  - The law of large numbers emphasizes the relationship between a larger sample size and its ability to represent the population's average, while the central tendency theorem focuses on how a larger sample represents the distribution of the population.

In simpler terms, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a statistical principle that suggests when you have a sufficiently large sample from a population with  a finite level of variance, the average of all the variables in those samples will closely resemble the average of the entire population. Additionally, as the sample size increases, these samples tend to take on a bell-shaped, normal distribution, and their variances become more and more similar to the population's variance, in accordance with the law of large numbers.
