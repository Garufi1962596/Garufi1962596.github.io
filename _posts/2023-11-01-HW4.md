In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.

key takeaways:
  - The law of large numbers asserts that when you take a sufficiently large sample, the observed average of that sample will closely approximate the true average of the entire population. Furthermore, this approximation becomes even closer as the sample size increases.

  - It's important to note that the law of large numbers doesn't guarantee that a given sample, especially a small one, will accurately reflect the characteristics of the entire population. Nor does it ensure that an unrepresentative sample will be corrected by a subsequent one.

  - The law of large numbers emphasizes the relationship between a larger sample size and its ability to represent the population's average, while the central tendency theorem focuses on how a larger sample represents the distribution of the population.
