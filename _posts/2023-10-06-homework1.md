- #### What is Statistics and its relationship with other disciplines. Difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics.

  Statistics can be defined as the art of applying scientific methods. As an art, statistics offer a better understanding and solution to 
  real-life problems as they provide quantitative information. While there are various statistical methods, the successful application of 
  these methods depends to a significant extent on the skill and specialized experience of the statistician, as well as their knowledge 
  of the specific field of application.According to Tippet: *“Statistic is both a science and an art. It is a science in that its methods 
  are basically systematic and have general application and art in that their successful application depends, to a considerable degree, 
  on the skill and special experience of the statistician, and on his knowledge of the field of application.”*
  
  Statistics plays a crucial role across various disciplines, including social sciences and management. In physical and natural sciences 
  such as Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Botany, Astronomy, Zoology, and Medicine, statistics has gained immense importance in recent years. In the realm of state administration, numerous government departments utilize statistics for their benefit and to ensure the successful execution of departmental initiatives. Within the field of Business and Commerce, statistics is instrumental in planning, analyzing, and executing strategies. 
  It serves as a valuable tool in decision-making processes, whether at the individual, collective, or governmental level. In essence, success in any endeavor hinges on effective planning, and statistics is an indispensable component of this planning process.
  
  
  Descriptive statistics involves the process of condensing a potentially large set of data points from a sample into meaningful summary values and visual representations. This approach enables data analysis and visualization, offering insights beyond the raw numbers. Descriptive statistics can be applied to describe both an entire population and individual samples. The data can either represent an entire population or be derived from a well-defined sampling procedure. In some instances, this data can stand alone to answer specific questions or address particular problems. Descriptive statistics encompass various techniques, such as data collection and tabulation, calculation of averages (measures of central tendency), assessment of data spread, creation of index numbers, evaluation of skewness, and more. These techniques aid in summarizing and describing the key characteristics of the data. Moreover, they help highlight important aspects of the data that might otherwise be overlooked due to its sheer volume.
  
  In contrast, inferential statistics involves making conclusions about entire populations by examining samples. It enables us to draw inferences about the entire set, including specific instances within it, based on information gathered from a subset of examples. These inferences rely on the principles of evidence and use sample statistics as a foundation for making broader conclusions. The accuracy of inferential statistics largely depends on the precision of sample data and how well it represents the larger population. Achieving this accuracy often requires obtaining a random sample. Results based on non-random samples are typically not considered reliable. While random sampling may not always be straightforward, it is of utmost importance in conducting effective inferential techniques.

- #### Describe the concepts of Population, Sample, Attribute, Variable, Level of measurement and Dataset.
  
  A population refers to a collection of similar items or occurrences that holds significance in the context of a particular question or 
 experiment. This statistical population can encompass either a group of real-world entities or a theoretical, potentially boundless 
 assembly of entities, conceptualized as an extrapolation based on past experiences. One prevalent objective of statistical analysis is 
 to generate insights and data regarding a specific chosen population.

  A sample is a set of individuals selected from a population, usually intended to represent the population in a study.
 
  Attributes pertain to the qualities or features associated with the subject of investigation, such as behaviors like smoking or drinking.

  A variable is a characteristic or condition that changes or has different values for different individuals.
 
  A dataset, often referred to as a data set, is a compilation of information. Typically, a dataset corresponds to the contents of a single database table, or a single statistical data matrix, where every column of the table represents a particular variable, and each row corresponds to a given member of the data set in question.

  The concept of "level of measurement" or "scale of measure" is a categorization that characterizes the type of data represented by the values assigned to variables. The most recognized classification system, which comprises four distinct levels or scales of measurement, can be divided into:
   -	Nominal
   -	Ordinal
   -	Interval
   -	Ratio
    
- #### Briefly describe the main sampling methods.
     There are two primary types of sampling methods that you can use in your research:
  
    -	***Probability sampling*** involves random selection, allowing you to make strong statistical inferences about the whole group.
    -	***Non-probability sampling*** involves non-random selection based on convenience or other criteria, allowing you to easily collect             data.
 
      

  1. ***Simple random sampling***:
          In a simple random sample, every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
  2. ***Systematic sampling***:
          Every member of the population is listed with a number, but instead of randomly generating numbers, individuals are chosen at             regular intervals.
  3. ***Stratified sampling***:
          Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subpopulations that may differ in important ways.
  4. ***Cluster sampling***:
          Instead of sampling individuals from each subgroup, you randomly select entire subgroups.
  5. ***Convenience sampling***:
          A convenience sample simply includes the individuals who happen to be most accessible to the researcher.
  6. ***Voluntary response sampling***:
         Instead of the researcher choosing participants and directly contacting them, people volunteer themselves.
  7. ***Purposive sampling***:
         This type of sampling, also known as judgement sampling, involves the researcher using their expertise to select a sample that             is most useful to the purposes of the research
  8. ***Snowball sampling***:
         If the population is hard to access, snowball sampling can be used to recruit participants via other participants.
  9. ***Quota sampling***:
         Quota sampling relies on the non-random selection of a predetermined number or proportion of units.
  
  
- #### Briefly describe the main experiment designs.
    Experimental design refers to how participants are allocated to an experiment’s different conditions. There are three types:

   1. ***Independent measures / between-groups***: each condition of the experiment involves a separate group of participants.
   2. ***Repeated measures /within groups***: The same participants take part in each condition of the independent variable. This               means that each experiment condition includes the same group of participants.
   3. ***Matched pairs***: Each condition uses different participants, but they are matched in terms of important characteristics,             e.g., gender, age, intelligence, etc. One member of each pair is then placed into the experimental group and the other member             into the control group.
