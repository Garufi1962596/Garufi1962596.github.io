#### What is Statistics and its relationship with other disciplines. Difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics:

Statistics can be defined as the art of applying scientific methods. As an art, statistics offer a better understanding and solution to real-life problems as they provide quantitative information. While there are various statistical methods, the successful application of these methods depends to a significant extent on the skill and specialized experience of the statistician, as well as their knowledge of the specific field of application.According to Tippet: *“Statistic is both a science and an art. It is a science in that its methods are basically systematic and have general application and art in that their successful application depends, to a considerable degree, on the skill and special experience of the statistician, and on his knowledge of the field of application.”*

Statistics plays a crucial role across various disciplines, including social sciences and management. In physical and natural sciences such as Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Botany, Astronomy, Zoology, and Medicine, statistics has gained immense importance in recent years. In the realm of state administration, numerous government departments utilize statistics for their benefit and to ensure the successful execution of departmental initiatives. Within the field of Business and Commerce, statistics is instrumental in planning, analyzing, and executing strategies. 
It serves as a valuable tool in decision-making processes, whether at the individual, collective, or governmental level. In essence, success in any endeavor hinges on effective planning, and statistics is an indispensable component of this planning process.


Descriptive statistics involves the process of condensing a potentially large set of data points from a sample into meaningful summary values and visual representations. This approach enables data analysis and visualization, offering insights beyond the raw numbers. Descriptive statistics can be applied to describe both an entire population and individual samples. The data can either represent an entire population or be derived from a well-defined sampling procedure. In some instances, this data can stand alone to answer specific questions or address particular problems. Descriptive statistics encompass various techniques, such as data collection and tabulation, calculation of averages (measures of central tendency), assessment of data spread, creation of index numbers, evaluation of skewness, and more. These techniques aid in summarizing and describing the key characteristics of the data. Moreover, they help highlight important aspects of the data that might otherwise be overlooked due to its sheer volume.

In contrast, inferential statistics involves making conclusions about entire populations by examining samples. It enables us to draw inferences about the entire set, including specific instances within it, based on information gathered from a subset of examples. These inferences rely on the principles of evidence and use sample statistics as a foundation for making broader conclusions. The accuracy of inferential statistics largely depends on the precision of sample data and how well it represents the larger population. Achieving this accuracy often requires obtaining a random sample. Results based on non-random samples are typically not considered reliable. While random sampling may not always be straightforward, it is of utmost importance in conducting effective inferential techniques.
