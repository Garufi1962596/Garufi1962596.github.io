# Poisson point process

In the realms of probability, statistics, and related disciplines, a Poisson point process emerges as a stochastic concept where points are distributed randomly 
in a mathematical space, with a crucial characteristic being the independence of these points. This concept is known by various names such as Poisson random measure,
Poisson random point field, or Poisson point field, and when applied to the real number line, it is commonly termed the Poisson process.

This mathematical abstraction possesses favorable properties, rendering it a prevalent model in diverse fields including astronomy, biology, ecology, geology,
seismology, physics, economics, image processing, and telecommunications. Despite its nomenclature, the process is named after French mathematician Siméon Denis
Poisson, although he did not directly explore it. The term "Poisson" originates from the observation that in a Poisson process, the number of points within a finite
region follows a Poisson distribution, a well-established probability distribution.

Frequently defined on the real number line and conceptualized as a stochastic process, the Poisson point process maintains the property that each point is 
stochastically independent of all others within the process, justifying its occasional characterization as a purely random or completely random process. 
In cases where point-to-point interactions are intense and non-independent, alternative point processes prove more suitable for accurate modeling.

The characterization of the Poisson point process involves the Poisson distribution, describing the probability distribution of a random variable "N," 
known as a Poisson random variable. The probability that "N" equals "n" is expressed as:

\[ \Pr\{N = n\} = \frac{\lambda^n}{n!} \times e^{-\lambda} \]

Here, "n!" represents the factorial of "n," and the parameter "λ" determines the shape of the distribution, equivalent to the expected value of "N."

By definition, the Poisson point process ensures that the number of points within a bounded region of the underlying space follows a Poisson-distributed
random variable. Considering separate and bounded subregions within the space, the number of points within each subregion is entirely independent of others,
a property often termed as complete randomness, complete independence, or independent scattering. This lack of interaction between different regions and points 
is the hallmark of the Poisson process, occasionally described as a purely random or completely random process. The parameter "λ" is interpreted as the average number 
of points per unit extent, also known as the mean density or mean rate. When applied to the real number line as a model for events or occurrences, this process ensures that the positions of these events are uniformly distributed (like in HW5). In other words the process ensures that event positions within an interval (a, b] are determined by a uniform random variable within that interval, often construed as time. This specific variant of the Poisson process is sometimes referred to as the uniform Poisson point process.
